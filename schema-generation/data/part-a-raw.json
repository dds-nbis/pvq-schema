All individuals who work for or on behalf of the U.S. federal government are investigated at least once. After the initial investigation, further investigations depend on many variables.\n\nSome investigations result in a security clearance determination or a determination of eligibility to occupy a sensitive position. This section asks questions regarding your eligibility determination or security clearance determination, if applicable. Information requested includes whether or not you were granted eligibility to occupy a sensitive position or a security clearance or have had either denied, suspended, or revoked. The U.S. federal agency that investigated you may or may not be the same U.S. federal agency that granted, denied, suspended, or revoked your security clearance.\n\nThis section also asks for information regarding whether or not the U.S. Government has debarred you from Federal employment. If you were found unsuitable under 5 CFR 731 by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management or an agency, a period during which you were denied examination for, and appointment to, all or specific covered positions within the U.S. Government is considered a debarment period. Your debarment could be either government-wide or from a particular agency or positions within that agency.\n\nInvestigations are also used to determine whether you are eligible for a Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credential. This credential grants you physical access to Federal space and/or logical access to federal information technology (IT) systems. This section asks questions regarding any prior credentialing decisions where you were denied a PIV or had a PIV suspended or revoked, as applicable.\n\nWe also want to know if a foreign government has ever investigated you or granted you a security clearance. Foreign means non-U.S. -- that is, outside of the 50 U.S. states, District of Columbia, and U.S. territories."

Examples of federal non-tax debt include past due federally guaranteed or insured loans such as student and home mortgage loans, overpayment of benefits, or other debts to the U.S. Government. This section also focuses on the actions you have taken to address past due financial obligations, as applicable.\n\nFor this section:\n\n• Past due:\n\n- Means a payment was not made by its due date or by the end of the grace period, if applicable.\n\n- For other debts paid in installments, such as loans, \"past due\" means a payment was not made by its due date or by the end of the grace period, if applicable.\n\n- You are not \"past due\" if you were approved for a tax extension and you filed and paid your taxes by the extension due date.\n\n• A tax year is the 12 months covered by a tax return.\n\n• A guarantor is an individual who promises to pay a borrower's debt in the event the borrower defaults on their loan obligation."
