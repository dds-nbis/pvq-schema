This applies whether the account is maintained for the person's own benefit or for the benefit of others. Examples of foreign financial interests include foreign (non-U.S.) stocks, bonds, property, investments, bank accounts, ownership of corporate entities, corporate interests or exchange traded funds (ETFs) held in specific geographical or economic sectors. Foreign financial interests do not include financial interests in companies or diversified mutual funds or diversified ETFs that are publicly traded on a U.S. exchange.\n\n• A dependent child is an unmarried child, stepchild, legally adopted child or foster child, or child of a domestic partner who is: 1) younger than 19 years old, 2) at least 19 but less than age 24 years old and who regularly attends an accredited school or college, or 3) permanently and totally disabled -- and, in all 3 cases is primarily dependent on you for support and maintenance.\n\n• For purposes of this form a committed, spouse-like relationship is defined as a relationship between two people who are not in a legally-recognized marriage, union, or domestic partnership, present themselves as a couple, and live together continuously."
