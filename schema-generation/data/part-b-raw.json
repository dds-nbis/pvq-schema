Many non-U.S. countries issue \"identity cards\" which can be used for international travel. Some of these identity cards cannot be used for international travel and are issued for other reasons (for example, as identification, to claim benefits, to digitally sign documents, etc.). For this question, only list an identity card if it can be used for international travel, even if you have never used it for international travel. Consider the term \"identity card\" to include all identity documents, citizenship cards, registration documents, foreign visas, or other similar documents that can be used for international travel."
