After the initial investigation, further investigations depend on many variables.\\n\\nSome investigations result in a security clearance determination or a determination of eligibility to occupy a sensitive position. This section asks questions regarding your eligibility determination or security clearance determination, if applicable. Information requested includes whether or not you were granted eligibility to occupy a sensitive position or a security clearance or have had either denied, suspended, or revoked. The U.S. federal agency that investigated you may or may not be the same U.S. federal agency that granted, denied, suspended, or revoked your security clearance.\\n\\nThis section also asks for information regarding whether or not the U.S. Government has debarred you from Federal employment. If you were found unsuitable under 5 CFR 731 by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management or an agency, a period during which you were denied examination for, and appointment to, all or specific covered positions within the U.S. Government is considered a debarment period. Your debarment could be either government-wide or from a particular agency or positions within that agency.\\n\\nInvestigations are also used to determine whether you are eligible for a Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credential. This credential grants you physical access to Federal space and/or logical access to federal information technology (IT) systems. This section asks questions regarding any prior credentialing decisions where you were denied a PIV or had a PIV suspended or revoked, as applicable.\\n\\nWe also want to know if a foreign government has ever investigated you or granted you a security clearance. Foreign means non-U.S. -- that is, outside of the 50 U.S. states, District of Columbia, and U.S. territories."
